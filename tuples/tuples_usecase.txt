  Tuples use case scenario
	1) Tuples are immutable therefore it allows both programmers and interpreters to understand that data needs to be not 
	manipulated/changed.
	2) Tuples are used as dictionary without keys. Example:- (('What men live by', 'Leo Tolstoy', 1957), ('Permanent Record', 'Edward Snowden', 2019))
	3) Tuples are also used as key for dictionary since they are immutable and therefore hashable( mostly )
	4) Tuples are faster than lists
	5) Tuples are easier to read. Example:- [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)] are much easier to read than [[1,2], [3,4], [5,6]]
