#  while loops execute a block of code for as long it satisfies the condition

#  An Example of infinite loop
#  while 1:
    #  print("Stuck in a while loop")

#  An Example of finite loop 
#  name = "" 
#  while len(name) == 0 :
    #  name = input("Enter name: ")

#  An alternative way is as follows :-
name = None
while not name:
    name = input("Enter name: ")
